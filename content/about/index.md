# Welcome!
One more developer's personal webpage / blog.
Yes, I know, they are a dime a dozen :) .

It serves mostly for my own note taking/documentation.
It would be nice if some of its content was also useful to some people.

I have been a long time free software and linux enthousiast, fascinated by computer programming.
Any comment is appreciated and welcomed, please feel free to contact me.
